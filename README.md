# Blackjack Game

A simple console-based game of Blackjack implemented in Python. The game allows the player to play against the dealer by drawing cards, deciding whether to hit or stand, and determining the winner based on the standard rules of Blackjack.

## How to Play

- The game will deal two cards to the player and the dealer.
- The player can choose to either 'hit' (draw another card) or 'stand' (keep the current hand).
- The dealer will draw cards until their total value is at least 17.
- The goal is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer without going over.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Run the game using the command:

```bash
